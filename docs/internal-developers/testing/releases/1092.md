## WooCommerce Core

### Bug Fixes

#### Load Interactivity API in `bootstrap.php` [#10657](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10657)

1. *Ignore this step if testing in WooCommerce Core.* Install this custom build of WooCommerce that includes this patch: [woocommerce.zip](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/files/12378677/woocommerce.zip).
2. Make sure that `WooCommerce Blocks` plugin is not active.
3. Open the Site Editor and ensure that you are using the blockified template on the Product Catalog template.
4. Visit the `/shop` page and ensure that the Product Button(Add to Cart) works as expected.

#### Make View Cart link displayed below the Add to Cart button [#10675](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10675)

1. Edit Product Catalog template
2. Add Products (Beta) block if it's not there already
3. Save and go to frontend
4. Add a simple product to cart
5. Expected: "View Cart" link appears BELOW the Add to Cart button
