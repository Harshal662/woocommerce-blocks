### Bug Fixe

#### Remove client side navigation from Products beta block. [#10636](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10636)

1. Create a new post
2. Add Products (Beta) block & publish it
3. On Frontend, verify that
    1. Client-side navigation isn't there anymore i.e. changing the page should also refresh the page
    2. Verify that Product button(Add to cart) still works as expected.
